# WTI Oil Returns and Volatility Modeling Project

This repository contains an advanced time series analysis project focused on forecasting WTI crude oil returns and volatility. The project employs **EViews 13's internal programming language** to implement a wide range of econometric models for forecasting and performance evaluation.

> **Disclaimer:** Running the EViews programs requires a **paid version of EViews 13**.

## Key Features
- **Variable of Interest:** Daily changes in the WTI crude oil spot price (in levels).
- **Mean Modeling:** Comparison of ARMA, SETAR, TAR, and Markov Switching models.
- **Volatility Modeling:** FIGARCHX with Brentd as a variance regressor, benchmarked against GARCH(1,1).
- **Model Validation:** Post-estimation diagnostic tests and performance metrics, including MSE, MAE, RMSE, and Theil inequality coefficients.
- **Rolling Window Forecasting:** 15-day and 20-day rolling forecasts for the mean and volatility, respectively.

## Methodology

### Data Preparation
- **Unit Root Testing:** Applied Breakpoint Unit Root and ADF tests to ensure stationarity.
- **Differencing:** Converted all series to first differences to address unit root issues.
- **Break Detection:** Identified structural breaks due to COVID-19 (April 2020) and excluded pre-break data to improve model robustness.

### Mean Models
- **SETAR (Chosen Model):** Demonstrated the best forecasting performance and passed all post-estimation diagnostic tests.
- **ARMA:** Used as a baseline candidate model, with AR(3) identified as the best configuration.
- **Markov Switching:** Explored regime-switching dynamics with significant transition parameters.
- **TAR:** Included lag-based threshold variables for comparison.

### Volatility Models
- **FIGARCHX (Chosen Model):** Outperformed GARCH(1,1) by capturing long memory effects and including Brentd as a variance regressor.
- **GARCH(1,1):** Served as a benchmark, showing robust but comparatively weaker performance.

---

## Key Results
- **Mean Modeling:** The SETAR model excelled in forecasting WTI returns, outperforming ETS-smoothed benchmarks across all loss functions.
- **Volatility Modeling:** FIGARCHX demonstrated superior accuracy in forecasting volatility, accounting for long memory and Brentd's variance effects.

## Future Work
- Incorporating intraday data (e.g., hourly observations of the S&P Energy Index) and applying MIDAS techniques to improve both mean and volatility models.
- Expanding the dataset by merging similar subsets post-structural break to increase sample size and model robustness.

## Running the Code
1. **Import Data:**
   - Load `data.xls` into EViews as a workfile:  
     `File -> Open -> Foreign Data as Workfile`.
2. **Run Program:**
   - Execute `.prg` files to replicate the models:  
     `File -> Open -> Programs`.
3. **Requirements:**
   - **EViews 13 (Paid Version):** Necessary to run the code.
   - Knowledge of EViewsâ€™ internal programming language.
